The scene I decided to create is a nice one person bedroom. I am in my fourth year of
college and I have been in a double or triple every year so far (as most people have), 
so I wanted to daydream a little bit with this project by designing a solid single 
that I would be happy living in. The room contains all the basics such as a bed, desk
with a computer, night stand, dresser, and various decorations. I decided to go with
an evening sky skybox texture because I feel like that gives the room a much more
cozy vibe. The main character in  the scene is the blue jay that is chilling on the 
bed. Birds are super cool.
